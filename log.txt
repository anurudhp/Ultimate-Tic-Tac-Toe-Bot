vs Random:
	wrong heuristic with (10^10, 10^5, 10^0):
		105	-	25	(first)
		4	-	106	(second)
	
	kind of fixed heuristic with (10^10, 10^5, 10^0):
		142 - 59 | (14 games, average: 10 - 4) [first]
		3 - 73 | (5 games, average: 0 - 14) [second]
	
	fixed heuristic with (100, 30, 1):
		127 - 22 | (10 games, average: 12.70 - 2.20) [first] (noticably better 10^10, 10^5, 1 - why??)
		73 - 104 | (13 games, average: 5.61 - 8.0) [second]
	
	fixed heuristic with (10^10, 10^5, 10^0):
		160 - 46 | (15 games, average: 10.66 - 3.6) [first]
		9 - 220 | (15 games, average: 0.60 - 14.66) [second] (REALLY good - why?)
